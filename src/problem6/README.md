# API Service Module Documentation

## Overview

This module is responsible for handling user score updates and maintaining the top 10 user scores on a scoreboard. It ensures real-time updates and includes security measures to prevent unauthorized score manipulations.

## Features

1. Real-time update of the scoreboard.
2. API endpoint for updating user scores.
3. Security measures to prevent unauthorized score increases.

## Endpoints
